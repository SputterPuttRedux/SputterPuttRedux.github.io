    <p>I'd be lying if I said that researching for <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com">DBC</a>'s cultural blog assignment this week was the first time I'd ever heard of gender imbalance in the tech community.  It's not.  I don't think that it's any secret to anyone who isn't even directly involved in the tech industry; a look at pop culture makes this apparent.  I think everyone's familar with the stereotype of the under-exposed, highly intelligent male computer whiz. That particular archetype has been present in movies and on TV for years now.  And although we've had female analogs--Angelina Jolie in Hackers comes to mind--the stereotype of the male computer expert persists.</p>

    <p>Most folks who've been around on this great green earth for a while can readily admit--for good or for bad--that stereotypes are often informed from reality in one way or another.  And in this case, the stereotype of the male computer whiz directly reflects the reality of the gender makeup of the tech industry.  It's male-dominated world.  And it can often be an unwelcoming and inhospitable place for women who dare venture inside.</p>

    <p>There's been a slew of articles recently about women in tech witnessing (and oftentimes being the target of) abhorrent gender-focused conduct from their male counterparts. Indeed, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/07/01/tinder_sexual_harassment_suit_former_executive_claims_she_was_called_a_whore.html">Tinder</a>, <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/every-fucked-up-text-from-the-tinder-sexual-harassment-1598642609">SnapChat</a>, <a href="http://www.thefrisky.com/2013-10-09/this-sexist-flier-was-spotted-in-the-ladies-bathroom-at-twitters-headquarters/">Twitter</a> and even <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/">Github</a> have all had highly-publicized instances of sexism and harassment revealed to the public at large</p>

    <p>As a woman transitioning (hopefully) to a career in tech, I find these stories troubling.  Having come from a profession that was male-dominated and that could, at times, feel like a boy's club of sorts, I know how painful, exhausting and frustrating facing down gender-bias can be. I can only hope that the fact that recent statistics on women who pursue STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) degrees will mean a huge influx of women in this industry is coming and is coming fast.  Ultimately, I know my presence--and the presence of all the other women in DBC cohorts near and far--will be a step in the right direction.  A step toward gender equality.</p>
