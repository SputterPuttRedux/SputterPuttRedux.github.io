    <p>Whaddup, Ruby Noobs?  In this edition of my DBC technical blog, I am tasked with teaching you a bit about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)" target="_blank">classes</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure" target="_blank">data structures</a>. Read on to treat yourself to some knowlege:</p>
    <img src="../images/treat_yo_self.gif" />

    <p>So, if you bothered to read the embedded links I provided in my introductory sentence, (which, I can't fault you if you didn't) you would've come across two somewhat long, but rather approachable <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> articles on those subjects.  Cool right?  It's my hope that this blog post will be at least as approachable as those artices, with the added benefit of being exponentially shorter.  So to begin, at it's most basic, a data structure is a way to organize information in a computer.  There's not just one data structure;  oh no, there are many different kinds whose organization may be particularly suited for one kind of data retrieval or another, depending.</p>
    <p> A real world example that comes to mind that might help to conceptualize the idea of data strutures is a flow-chart--especially ones that assist with binary decision-making.  Take this example:</p>
    <img src = "../images/mercury_flowchart.jpg"/>
    <p>Flow chart brought to you courtesy of <a href="http://blobsite.net/tag/freddie-mercury/">blobsite.net</a>

    <p>If you were tasked with the decision of organizing Freddie Mercury's wants in a format that's easily retrievable by a computer, you might do so by organizing them into a data structure called a hash, like so:</p>
    <img src="../images/mercury_hash.png" />
    <p>If you don't remember what a hash is, it's cool.  Just check out <a href="" target="_blank">my previous blog post</a> on the subject. "But, Dionne," you say "isn't there also an <a href="" target="_blank">array</a> in that mess of code you just posted?" You're correct, dear reader.  There's also an array at the first key's value.  And if you remember from my <a href="" target="_blank">post</a> an array's also a data structure. It's particularly useful in this hash because Freddie Mercury has a lot of wants.  Having his wants organized into a separate structure just makes them easier to access, as you'll see in a bit.</p>

    <h3>So, Where do Classes Come in to All of This?</h3>

    <p>Well, classes have some similarities to data structures, in the sense that they organize information.  Unlike data structures though, classes can contain more than just raw data.  Let's get back to our Freddie Mercury example from earlier.  Look at this code: </p>

    <code>
      <pre>
      class FreddieMercury

        def initialize
         @freddie_Mercury = {
            "wants" => ["to break free","to ride his bicycle","it all now", "to make a supersonic man outta you"],
            "doesnt_want" => "you to stop him now",
            "isnt_sure" => "live forever"
          }

          things = rand(0..@freddie_Mercury["wants"].length-1)
          @wants = @freddie_Mercury["wants"][things]
          @doesnt_want = @freddie_Mercury["doesnt_want"]
          @isnt_sure = @freddie_Mercury["isnt_sure"]

          p "Does Freddie Mercury want #{@wants}? Y/N?"
          self.get_input
        end

        def get_input
          @answer = gets.chomp.upcase.to_s
          self.check
        end

        def check

          if @answer == "N"
            p "The only thing Freddie Mercury doesn't want is for #{@doesnt_want}."
          elsif @answer == "Y"
            p "Okay. You know Freddie Mercury."
          else
            p "Freddie Mercury isn't sure if he wants to #{@isnt_sure}. I'm not sure what letters you entered. Y/N?"
            self.get_input
          end

        end
        end
      </pre>
    </code>

    <p>Above, I've created a class called <code>FreddieMercury</code>.  See that capitalization? It's an important naming convention that follows best practices with regard to classes in Ruby.  You can also see that my <code>FreddieMercury</code> class contains the hash we talked about earlier. The class also contains other things--and the function of those other things is what makes classes special.</p>

    <p>See all that code up there that begins and ends with <code>def</code> and <code>end</code>?  Those are called methods. Methods tell a computer to actually <strong>do</strong> something to the object the method is called on. In the case of my code, my <code>#get_input</code> method retrieves information from a user and my <code>#check</code> method measures that input against the hash I've stored in my <code>FreddieMercury</code> class. When methods are inside of classes like <code>FreddieMercury</code> those methods can be used on objects that are in the class. If I'd made a different class, for example, a class called <code>LisaLeftEyeLopez</code> I wouldn't be able to use my <code>FreddieMercury</code> methods (unless I imported those methods, but that's a subject for a different blog entry).</p>
    <p>Look again at <code>FreddieMercury</code>. Do you also see the code that's prefaced by the <code>@</code> symbol?  You might recognize how that code functions within the methods if you look closely. Those are variables, and that special <code>@</code> notation makes them available throughout the class; they're called instance variables and all the methods in the class can access them.</p>

    <p>What about that <code>#initialize</code> business, that's at the very beginning of the class?  Whelp, any time you create or <strong>define</strong> a class, you've gotta intialize it.  Initialization makes the class (and all the things within the class) accessible to a programmer. The notation to bring about a new instance of a class is <code>Class.new</code> </p>

    <p>Now, it's all fine and well to talk about how to make a class, what a class contains, and how to make a class accessible, but what <strong>is</strong> a class exactly? Well, check out some of the examples on <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby-for-newbies-working-with-classes--net-15938" target="_blank">this</a> great Ruby tutorial page. Compare those example that to the examples I've included above, and I think you'll have a good introduction into this programming concept.</p>

    <p>P.S.  Any idea what my <code>FreddieMercury</code> does?  Run it in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell" target="_blank">IRB</a> to find out!</p>
