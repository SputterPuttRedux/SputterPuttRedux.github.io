    <p>This week's cultural blog entry is going to be tough, folks.  The topic is <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html" target = "_blank">Stereotype Threat</a>and for the majority of my life, I've known the feelings associated with this particular phenonmenon all too well. Le Sigh.  But let me get to giving you some background on exactly what this phenomenon is before we get into the heavy stuff, eh? </p>
    <p>So, this guy:</p>
    <img src="http://www.socialpsychology.org/thumb/4319/0/md.jpg"/>
    <p>is brilliant.  In fact, it's more than a little irreverent to refer to him as "this guy" as I do here as he is a preeminent academic whos published <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Steele#references" target="_blank">multiple peer-reviewd studies</a> and is known as the expert in this particular field of study.  His name is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Steele">Claude M. Steele</a> and for all intents an purposes, you can think of him as the man who proved that this phenomenon is real.</p>
    <p>So what is Stereotype Threat?  Well, I'll never be able to put is as eloquently as Prof. Steele, but based on notes I took from the articles I read in preparation for this blog entry, you can think of it this way: Stereotype Threat arises when an individual (or group of individuals) is in a situation where one of the negative stereotypes about her identity(ies) could be applied to her. The realization by that individual that she could be judged or reduced to nothing more than the stereotype is the threat. And often what occurs around this realization is a quantifiable interference with functioning on a number of levels.</p>
    <p>On the surface, it might seem like I'd qualify more as an outlier in regard to the demographic groups Prof. Steele's work has focused on.  Indeed--I am an African American woman who's acheived quite a bit of academic success in the span of my life; I've obtained two post-graduate degrees, and I successfully practiced criminal defense for a number of years before somewhat recently deciding to switch careers to another academically challenging profession.  But despite my "acheivements" that look pretty in print, I can tell you that there have been multiple times in my life (continuing through to the present) where I have felt Stereotype Threat acutely, and I have suffered because of it.</p>
    <p>One example that demonstrates my own experience with Stereotype Threat occurred when I first began my undergraduate studies. I attened a small, predominantly white, academically rigourous liberal arts college located in a suburb of Philadelphia.  When I got there, I expected to be surrounded by academics. I mean, I knew what the admission requirements were; obviously, as I'd gone through the process of applying myself. Yet, I could not anticipate how much my blackness and my womanhood would be interpreted as an explanation for perceived academic inferiority. And I was percieved as inferior a LOT.  This was somewhat attributable to the heavy, working-class black Baltimorean accent I had when I arrived.  If there are any fans of <a href="http://www.hbo.com/the-wire#/" target="blank">The Wire</a> out there, conjure to mind the character of <a href="http://www.hbo.com/the-wire#/the-wire/cast-and-crew/felicia-snoop-pearson/index.html" target="_blank">Snoop</a>, but take away most of the grittiness, and add a healthy dose of correct grammar (but not all correct) and you've got a good idea of what I sounded like when I started my freshman year.  People reacted to the way I talked overtly.  From good-natured ribbing about my frequent use of folk-idioms and backward country colloquialisms, to flat-out confusion about what I was actually saying, I knew right away that my accent was an issue for folks; they made it apparent to me constantly. But the accent was just the tip of the iceburg.  At first glance, it might seem almost too trivial of an example to try to demonstrate my experience with Stereotype Threat.  Afterall, I <strong>could</strong> have just masked my accent--which I eventually did--and be done with it.  But the accent was just a larger reflection of who I was and where I'd come from.  It's presence reinforced in the minds of others that I was different  from them.  I was different in a way that was incongruent with their ideas of intelligence. My accent confirmed that at least <strong>one</strong> stereotype about black people held true for me.  Afterall, black people speak differently from whites, right?  And if one black person is speaking in a way that's associated with "how black people speak" what else about them is just like "how black people are?" </p>
    <p>My blackness in combination with my womanhood often proved to be a much too potent mix for some during my college days (and beyond).  I wasn't allowed to be outwardly angry, lest I also be perceived as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angry_Black_Woman" target="_blank">angry black woman</a>.  The fact that I can provide a link to that phrase that will take you to more information (a Wikipedia article, no less!) about the subject, just confrms the pervasiveness of that stereotype. I was constantly preoccupied with whether my demeanor could have been perceived as overly aggressive for that reason.  Add to all this that I'm gay, and that I regularly have the  man-hater stereotype to contend with, and you can begin to see how this all becomes exhausting after a while.</p>
    <p>For a very long time I internalized my struggles with stereotypes.  Like the good "model minority" I've tried to be for so long, I would just put my head down and try to fight against the perception.  If someone thought my accent was too foreign, or too unfamiliar, I would change it.  If my demenor could be percieved as overly aggressive, I would calm it down to near vapidity.  Nowadays, though, I don't try to fight against stereotypes as much as I used to.  Admittedly, there's a large part of my stereotype struggle that's ingrained at this point, but I'm still aware of how much space stereotypes (and reacting to/against them in one way or another) take up in my life.  At DBC, I hope my awareness around these issues will help me articulate what's happening if I begin to feel the threat brewing. Hopefully, my experience can help others who've maybe dealt with this as well.  At the least, we could commiserate and reassure one another that we're not alone.</p>
