    <p>This week we've been tasked with revisiting the topic of last week's Cultural Blog, <a>Stereotype Threat</a>. Check out the link for more information on that phenomenon.</p>
    <p>As a vehicle for further discussion on the subject, we've been asked to pick among an extensive list of values and write about why one's importance.  I've chosen to talk about courage</p>
    <p>There have been more times in my life than I'd like to acknowledge where I've felt that I've lacked courage in some situation or another. At those times I was never faced with a choice to perform an act of death-defying heroism, but you couldn't tell that to the anxiety that I felt at the prospect of behaving courageously. It could feel just that scary. With age, wisdom (and a realization that most of the time, I wouldn't actually risk getting punched in the face for standing up in certain situations) I've gotten over the fear to show courage. And the times when I've acted--to do what I believed was the right thing in a given situation--in spite of the fear, I've always felt immensley rewarded. I've felt rewarded when I've stood up for what I believed in.  I've felt rewarded when I've come to the assistance of others. Showing courage in the face of fear has enabled me to feel more connected to others and to feel proud of myself for doing what's felt like the right thing. </p>

    <h2>Values in My Life</h2>
    <p>The other values I chose for this blog entry follow.  The numbers that appear next to the values corresponds to a number range that indicates the degree to which I try to live up to the values with 1 = Disagree and 5 = Agree.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Security: 4</li>
      <li>Spirituality: 5</li>
      <li>Self-Knowledge: 5</li>
      <li>Stability: 4</li>
      <li>Helping Others: 5</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advice</h2>
    <p>I was recently talking with a friend about the general topic of "what's important in life." Having reached a point where we'd both worked hard for many years at thankless jobs, we'd both come to the realization that the really important things rarely involve the hours you've devoted to an employer that kept you away from friends and family.  She asked me about my decision to leave the legal profession, as she was contemplating a similar move. I told her about my decision to try DBC.
    <h2>Values and Stereotype Threat</h2>
    <p>I can only hope that my values will help me to navigate the unpleasant waters the Stereotype Threat can churn up.  I've worked pretty diligently for the past year to cultivate a more developed sense of self than I've had at previous stages in my life.  Practically, that usually just means acknowledging within myself that whatever I'm feeling is valid. The really tough part is being gentle with myself when the threat rears its head. Meditation has been super helpful with allowing me to give myself the space to self-validate. </p>
