    <p>In this week's cultural blog, I'm tasked with examining conflict.  More specifically, within the virtual pages of this entry, I am going to explore a recent experience with an emotional conflict I've had and try to put it into perspective.
    Although DBC gave new boots a "pass" in terms of the intensity of the incident we explore--it's perfectly okay <strong>NOT</strong> to talk about something that's really emotionally charged--I've chosen to discuss a situation where I wasn't particularly proud of myself for my behavior. In fact, I'm kind of ashamed of how I acted. I think it's poignant to talk about this situtation, though.  It occured not too long ago in the relatviely recent past; it actually happend during Phase 0.  The situation really troubled me, b/c at the time, I was acutely aware that once the on-site phase of DBC began, I would be forced to interact with a variety of individuals whose experiences, world-views and belief systems may conflict with my own on any number of levels.  The way I responded in this situation did not leave me feeling very confident that I could easily navigate potential conflicts that could arise at DBC, and it had me really worried. </p>
    <p>I'll stop being cryptic now, and actually get to the meat of the conflict.  I know I've metioned in previous posts that I am an attorney.  I used to do particularly heart-wrenching work, but after I crashed and burned like the Hindenburg, I transtioned into doing legal work that was far easier, but nowhere near as fulfilling--legal temp work.  During almost all of phase 0 I did that work.   It was pretty informal and tedious stuff; it mostly involved hours of evaluating large numbers of documents for "relevance" to a particular law suit.  All of the projects I've worked on have involved small groups of people working on documents indivudally, but in a shared space.  I met a reviewer that I had a lot in common with at one of these projects. Let's call this person "Lee." Lee and I were similar politically and socially; we also had a shared off-kilter, nerdy sense of humor.  I really liked Lee a lot, and I decided that after DBC was all done, I'd reach out to Lee to hang out.  Now, you may have noticed that I have not used a gendered-pronoun when referring to Lee.  This is because this is how Lee prefers it to be.  Early on in our project Lee non-confrontationally and easily explained to the group that Lee  didn't identify with gendered-pronouns (it was apropos to a conversation we'd all been having at the time).  I knew that some of my other co-workers didn't understand Lee's request b/c they'd talked about as much when Lee wasn't present.  During those conversations,  I kept to myself on the subject of Lee's gender-identity. I kept to myself until one particular day.</p>
    <p> On this day, Lee didn't come into work due to a prior engagement Lee had scheduled. Everyone knew Lee wasn't going to be in--like I said, we worked in a small group.  In Lee's absense, once again, Lee's gender-identity came up as a topic of conversation.Other coworkers expressed confusion over Lee's "choice." Some expressed disdain for it, while others thought Lee was asking too much to have them "induldge" Lee's request. I didn't engage until one coworker said something that I considered mean, vicious and completely irrelevant to the topic of whether it was burdensome to use gender-neutral pronouns with Lee.   That's when I engaged--well, actually that's when I (more accurately)came unhinged.</p>
    <p>What happened wasn't pretty. I was confrontational.  I was loud. I focused on one particular coworker--we'll call him Charles for the purpose of my blog.  Charles was the most vocal of the bunch, expressing what I believed to be an intolerant point of view.  Initially, when I started talking to him about this issue, I tried to engage in a dialogue. In truth, though, I was bound to fail; I was keyed-up from the outset and ready for a fight. When Charles started explaining his opinion on the subject--which I thought was hackneyed and poorly thought out--I answered with aggressive dismissals. Essentially, I told him he didn't know anything and that he should find the time to read up on an issue before he started espousing claims about it.  Obviously, that response didn't go over well. It wasn't dialogic, it wasn't mutally engaging. The situation escalated; or, more accurately it devolved.  The conversation reached it's ugly culmination when another coworker gently touched me on my forearm and forced me to realize that not only had I raised my voice to a yell, but that I had crossed the line of workplace decorum by cursing. I backed down then, ashamed of myself and embarassed at having caused a scene.<p>
    <p>I went too far. In my heart I just wanted to do the right thing but I failed miserably.  I'd wanted to gently suggest to Charles that he should consider another point of view.  I wanted to remind him that Lee was a human being and that Lee had feelings. Ultimately, I accomplished none of that. After things calmed down, I apologized to Charles for yelling at him and for cursing; I knew, though, that  any "enlightened" point I'd been trying to make in defense of Lee was totally lost in my anger.  I tried to make it better, but I only made it worse.</p>
    <p> After the situation, when I got a chance to really reflect on what'd happened and how things had played out, I realized something very important.  I realized that I'd had such a strong reaction to Charles not only b/c I liked Lee and thought Lee was awesome, but also because I actually felt attacked by Charles. I took his insensitivity to Lee very personally, because I have deep and personal feelings around gender-identity, gender expression and sexual orientation.  Charles' intolearant viewpoint amplified my own fear of rejection that centers around my sexual orientation.</p>
    <p> If I could go back to that conflict I would obviously do things very differently.  I don't think I would try to avoid the subject altogether, though; I would do my utmost to keep my cool and I'd try to be level-headed in my approach.  Perhaps most importantly, I would try to check in with myself to to honestly gauge where my reaction was coming from.  Was the salient subject causing me to feel so passionately, or was something deeper going on?</p>
    <p> Despite the fact that  the conversation went horribly wrong, and despite the fact that I behaved in a way that I am not completely proud of, I did learn something about myself from that situation. I learned that I should get a better grasp on my acutal feelings before engaging someone on a subject for which I feel strongly.  In retrospect, I think that if I'd told Charles that I felt opposed to his opinions because they were hurtful to me, the conversatoin might have gone differently(At least I hope). I think that if I'd been able to articulate what had actually been going on with me, we would have been able to have a more fruitful, productive and dialogic conversation.  Going forward, this conversation will always remind me to be honest in my interactions with others and to be honest within myself.</p>
