    <p>Many moons ago in August of this year, I undertook the task of assessing my learning and thinking styles in anticipation of my admission into <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com" "target=_blank">DBC</a>.  I have to admit that going into the test, I expected to know it's outcome.  I mean, you don't live for 35 years and go to school for way too many of those years without thinking you know your academic self, right?  I also thought that my results would be easily gleaned by the nature of the question, themselves. Sort of like those cheesy magazine quizzes in that supposedly gauge your personality.</p>
    <p>Whelp, all this build-up I've written before actually getting to my results can only mean one thing.  I was super surprised at what the test revealed about me.  Apparently, I fall into the category of an <a href="" target="_blank">Abstract Sequential</a> thinker:</p>
    <p><img src="../images/abstract_Sequential.png" /></p>
    <p>Per the information in the handy-dandy chart I've included above (originally found <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" target="_blank">here</a>), I'm a lot less rigid in the way I approach learning than I thought I was.  Additional research on the subject of my learning style only convinced me that the test was real.  <a href="http://child-1st.typepad.com/my_weblog/2010/05/the-abstract-sequential-learning-style.html" target="_blank">This</a> article by a parent of an Abstract Sequential child really resonated with me.  I saw so many similarities between the way I actually know myself to be as a student, and the way the author's daughter was. It was really illuminating.</p>
    <p>Knowing more about my style of learning will, hopefully, benefit me while at DBC. First and foremost, I hope that this knowledge will help me to avoid becoming frustrated when situations fall outside of my learning "comfort-zone." I also hope this knowledge will enable me to be able to clearly articulate my needs to both my peers and my instructors in order to facilitate the best learning environment possible. </p>
    <p> I can already see how my learning style has impacted my experience in Phase 0 thus far. Specifically, I experienced the typical Abstract Sequential reaction to feeling rushed (or feeling that there is not enough time to complete a task at hand) during these past couple of weeks. In week 2 in particular, I felt really strapped for time.  This was due mostly to the fact that life happens. That particular week I had a convergence of responsibilites to attend events, and caring for a physically ill person on top of my full-time job and work due for DBC. I can only hope during DBC, I won't have to deal with outside events vying for my time. Nevertheless, I already know that the workload for DBC will be intense. In anticipation of that, I plan to try my utmost to be present within myself as much and as often as I can.  I plan to have self check ins wherein I attempt to notice whether I'm getting overwhelmed to the point of shutting down.</p>
    <p>Another aspect of the Abstract Sequential learning style that might prove difficult for me is group work that required me to collaborated with others of  differing views. When I read that description of an Abstract Sequential's characteristics, I felt that it was so true of me.  In the past, soometimes it has been somewhat difficult for me to acutally understand other people's approaches to learning.  In anticipation of all the group work we'll be doing in DBC, I will just have to keep reminding myself that not everyone learns the same.  Knowing this has already made me have some insight into some of the pairing sessions that I've had thus far.</p>
    <h4>Growth and Fixed Mindset and Their Interplay with my Learning Style.</h4>
    <p>During the Phase 0 prerequisite phase, when we firt had to research <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/" target="_blank">Growth & Fixed Mindset</a>, I immediately saw the ways that I've stifled my own learning by placing heavy importance on fixed mindset principles--I've focused on the outcomes of learning rather than the process; I've been reward-focused in learning; I've learned for grades, not for personal edification. Being aware of all these things will help me stay on top of the stuff that can creep up and impede learning and growth, I think. </p>
