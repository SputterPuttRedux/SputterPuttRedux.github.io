    <p>DBC is big on feedback. And when I say big, I mean <strong>BIG</strong> caps and bold are completely necessary to this description, folks. As a part of our curriculum (off-site phase included), we're required engage in all kinds of feedback acivity--whether giving or receiving. And this requirement is not some loosey-goosey, touch-feely exercise in futility, either.  The amount of feedback we contribute to the overall process factors directly into whether DBC feels we're progressing.  It's that big of a deal.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, I think constructive feeback is a super useful tool for assessing onself throughout any learning process, but in this world of ever-pervasive internet anonymity (not in the anonymity-doesn't-exist-on-the-internets-just-ask-Edward-Snowden kind of way, more like the ubiquitous-and-polarizing-anonymous-rants-in-the-comments-section-of-your-local-news-site kind of way) it's decidely unsettling at times to know that comments you make about folks will be accessible to them--and this is even taking into consideration DBC's policy on anonymous <a href="http://vimeo.com/99780302">A.S.K</a> feedback.</p>

    <p>Unsettling feelings notwithstanding, this feedback process has been predominantly positive for me. It's been like having someone hold up a mirror that reflects the dynamics that factor into how I problem-solve and work with others.  Don't mistake the positive feelings that I've taken away to mean that all of my feedback was awesome and easy to take, because that's not necessarily the case. Whenever anyone is shown a figurative mirror of oneself in any context, it's guaranteed that some of what's seen is gonna be cringe-worthy.   I just feel that I've grown from having received feedback in this context, b/c I have faith that every person who's left feedback for me, has taken it as seriously as I have when leaving feedback for others. And I have really taken it seriousely. </p>

    <p>It hasn't always been easy to leave feedback.  I've had a couple of pairing sessions where aspects my peronality just didn't jibe well with my pairing partner. In the end, those sessions felt less-than productive b/c our clashing personalities became a distraction--at least for me.  When those sessions were over, I was really nervous to leave honest feedback for a myriad of reasons. I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings, and besides, had I really accurately assessed those situations?   Ultimately, I decided I had to be honest.  If I really wanted to grow from this process,  I would have to fully partipate in both giving and receiving feedback b/c to do so was to be honest--honest with oneself and honest with others.  Honesty is one of the best vehicles through which to progress and grow, I think.</p>

    <p>Going forward, the collaborative process of peer-pairing may not always go swimmingly.  I don't expect every session to be sunshine and rainbows, afterall.  But the lens I've developed via the feedback I've recieved has definitely helped put peer pariing into perspective.  The first few nerve-wracking times are behind me--but the lessons my partners and I learned via fumbling through problems together have made the pairing sessions to come seem more than surmountable.   </p>
