  <p>I just finished watching a large portion of DBC founder Shereef Bishay's fireside chat, and I really have to say that I'm drinking the Kool-Aid, guys.  Word. This, despite the fact that Karim Bishay expressly stated that DBC isn't asking for that in the pre-phase 0 prep Emotional Intelligence video. Oh, yeaaahh! Haha.</p>

<p>Joking aside, I was really glad to have watched Shereef's chat; it covered a lot of questions I'd been thinking of prior to watching. The biggest thing I've taken away from the chat--and all of the pre-Phase 0 and Phase 0 work--is that i'm really digging the culture of DBC. I don't mean to sound corny, but it feels like this is the right fit.</p>

<p>By way of an example, I've engaged in meditation practice on and off for the last year or so.  Recently, my practice has been more off than on--I'm sad to admit--nevertheless, I constantly strive to be present within myself and within social situations.  So, when Karim talked about being present within the context of giving and receiving feedback, that really resonated with me.   When Shereef talked about fostering a collaborative environment, that resonated too.  My previous professional environment was so different from all of this.  As a criminal defense attorney, I lived everyday in an a predominantly antagnositc and adversarial world. And honestly, a little part of me felt like it was dying then. DBC feels more like the environment I should have been in; one that fosters creativity and that encourages sharing and openness. This is what I've been looking for.</p>

 <p>Don't get me wrong, I can't pretend I'm coming into this all awe and no fear. I'm scared shitless, guys. I am.  I'm scared of looking stupid.  I'm scared of being vulnerable enough to be okay with saying I'm wrong.  I'm scared of failing.  I'm just heartened that at DBC it seems that it's really okay to be scared and it's really okay to be wrong, and it sounds like DBC is really invested in each of us NOT failing.</p>

 <p>Anyway, that's my little take on this.  I'm really excited to meet everyone at DBC. Just counting down the days until Nov 17th, now!</p>
