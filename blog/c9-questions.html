    <p>In this weeek's cultural blog, I explore questions.  Specifically, DBC's interested in having we new boots explore the makings of good questions, their characteristics and the likelihood they'll get answers.</p>
    <p>For good or for bad, I haven't acutally posed many questions to the google community group that DBC established for my cohort.  There are reaons for that--through writing this post I've realized that my "reasons" are ones that I'll need to be aware of when physically on site.  Sometimes I havent' asked questions b/c I've preferred to work a problem out on my own.  This has been good and bad.  Sometimes, when I've chosen not to ask a question, I've been able to prove to myself that I could master a difficult concept on my own.  Mostly, though, not asking questions has resulted in me taking a much longer time to figure something out than if I'd just reached out for help. In all honesty, I also haven't asked quetions because sometimes I've felt that to do so, would be to show vulnerability. When you ask a question, that obvioulsy means that you don't know something, and showing that I don't know something a lot of times is cringe-inducing for me to say the least. I have to keep reminding myself that if there's any place to ask questions, it's DBC.  We're all there to learn. None of the new boots coming in are super-star developers.  If we were, we wouldn't be coming to DBC.</p>
    <p>Acknowledging that, when I finally do ask questions, I think the ones I ask are good in the sense that a lot of people are usually thinking the same thing that I want to ask anyway. So that can be reassuring, and helpful for me to overcome my fears around asking questions publicly.  Posing questions to/in non-public forums has never been particularly hard to do.  Internet searches are easy, but the merit of the questions I've run through various search engines is somewhat difficult to assess.  I've rarely found the right answer on the first try of an internet search, but regardless, I've inevitably gained something from googling.  Obviously, though, the more specific the question, the better.  When one can articulate the particular issue one's having trouble with, one is more likely to find the specific answer one needs.</p>
