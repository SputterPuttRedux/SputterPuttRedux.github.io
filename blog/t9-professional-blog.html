    <p>I'd never really been satisfied with the first version of this website, a snapshot of which I've included below:</p>

    <p>I've always liked the way that some websites have made use of transparent effects and vector images. I tried to incorporate those things in my first website--as you can see from the above image--but I never thought I'd executed it all that well. This week, when DBC gave us an opportunity to revisit the design of our websites, I was psyched.  I changed a lot of things (which you can see).  I did more research on effective website layout, and  I picked a color palette that was more conservative.  I was finally able to implement changes based on critiques I'd received from other boots eariler in the Phase.</p>
    <p>Overall, revamping my website was super fun.  I'm happy with the results; I think the new site has a better overall format for presenting information. Also, by virture of implementing the new changes, I was able to give my site a better structure "under the hood."  My stylesheets are arranged more sensibly (although arguably, they could probably be more DRY) & I used my tag IDs and Classes in a way that would allow me to make wide-sweeping changes to the site w/ relatively little effort.  Who knows? Maybe with these changes, I'll redesign the site more often?</p>
