    <h2>Musings on How I've Dealt in Situations where Conflict Arises</h2>

  <div class="blog" id="blog_entry">
    <p>In this week's cultural blog, I'm tasked with examining conflict.  More specifically, within the virtual pages of this entry, I am going to explore a recent experience with an emotional conflict I've had and try to put it into perspective.
    Although DBC gave new boots a "pass" in terms of the intensity of the incident we explore--it's perfectly okay <strong>NOT</strong> to talk about something that's really emotionally charged--I've chosen to discuss a situation where I wasn't particularly proud of myself for my behavior. In fact, I'm kind of ashamed of how I acted. I think it's poignant to talk about this situtation, though.  It occured not too long ago in the relatviely recent past; it actually happend during Phase 0.  The situation really troubled me, b/c at the time, I was acutely aware that once the on-site phase of DBC began, I would be forced to interact with a variety of individuals whose experiences, world-views and belief systems may conflict with my own on any number of levels.  The way I responded in this situation did not leave me feeling very confident that I could easily navigate potential conflicts that could arise at DBC, and it had me really worried. </p>
    <p>I'll stop being cryptic now, and actually get to the meat of the conflict.  I know I've metioned in previous posts that I am an attorney.  I used to do particularly heart-wrenching work, but after I crashed and burned like the Hindenburg, I transtioned into doing legal work that was far easier, but nowhere near as fulfilling--legal temp work.  During almost all of phase 0 I did that work.   It was pretty informal and tedious stuff; it mostly involved hours of evaluating large numbers of documents for "relevance" to a particular law suit.  All of the projects I've worked on have involved small groups of people working on documents indivudally, but in a shared space.  I met a reviewer that I had a lot in common with at one of these projects. Let's call this person "Lee." Lee and I were similar politically and socially; we also had a shared off-kilter, nerdy sense of humor.  I really liked Lee a lot, and I decided that after DBC was all done, I'd reach out to Lee to hang out.  Now, you may have noticed that I have not used a gendered-pronoun when referring to Lee.  This is because this is how Lee prefers it to be.  Early on in our project Lee non-confrontationally and easily explained to the group that Lee  didn't identify with gendered-pronouns (it was apropos to a conversation we'd all been having at the time).  I knew that some of my other co-workers didn't understand Lee's request b/c they'd talked about as much when Lee wasn't present.  During those conversations,  I kept to myself on the subject of Lee's gender-identity. I kept to myself until one particular day.</p>
    <p> On this day, Lee didn't come into work due to a prior engagement Lee had scheduled. Everyone knew Lee wasn't going to be in--like I said, we worked in a small group.  In Lee's absense, once again, Lee's gender-identity came up as a topic of conversation.Other coworkers expressed confusion over Lee's "choice." Some expressed disdain for it, while others thought Lee was asking too much to have them "induldge" Lee's request. I didn't engage until one coworker said something that I considered mean, vicious and completely irrelevant to the topic of whether it was burdensome to use gender-neutral pronouns with Lee.   That's when I engaged--well, actually that's when I (more accurately)came unhinged.</p>
    <p>What happened wasn't pretty. I was confrontational.  I was loud. I focused on one particular coworker--we'll call him Charles for the purpose of my blog.  Charles was the most vocal of the bunch, expressing what I believed to be an intolerant point of view.  Initially, when I started talking to him about this issue, I tried to engage in a dialogue. In truth, though, I was bound to fail; I was keyed-up from the outset and ready for a fight. When Charles started explaining his opinion on the subject--which I thought was hackneyed and poorly thought out--I answered with aggressive dismissals. Essentially, I told him he didn't know anything and that he should find the time to read up on an issue before he started espousing claims about it.  Obviously, that response didn't go over well. It wasn't dialogic, it wasn't mutally engaging. The situation escalated; or, more accurately it devolved.  The conversation reached it's ugly culmination when another coworker gently touched me on my forearm and forced me to realize that not only had I raised my voice to a yell, but that I had crossed the line of workplace decorum by cursing. I backed down then, ashamed of myself and embarassed at having caused a scene.<p>
    <p>I went too far. In my heart I just wanted to do the right thing but I failed miserably.  I'd wanted to gently suggest to Charles that he should consider another point of view.  I wanted to remind him that Lee was a human being and that Lee had feelings. Ultimately, I accomplished none of that. After things calmed down, I apologized to Charles for yelling at him and for cursing; I knew, though, that  any "enlightened" point I'd been trying to make in defense of Lee was totally lost in my anger.  I tried to make it better, but I only made it worse.</p>
    <p> After the situation, when I got a chance to really reflect on what'd happened and how things had played out, I realized something very important.  I realized that I'd had such a strong reaction to Charles not only b/c I liked Lee and thought Lee was awesome, but also because I actually felt attacked by Charles. I took his insensitivity to Lee very personally, because I have deep and personal feelings around gender-identity, gender expression and sexual orientation.  Charles' intolearant viewpoint amplified my own fear of rejection that centers around my sexual orientation.</p>
    <p> If I could go back to that conflict I would obviously do things very differently.  I don't think I would try to avoid the subject altogether, though; I would do my utmost to keep my cool and I'd try to be level-headed in my approach.  Perhaps most importantly, I would try to check in with myself to to honestly gauge where my reaction was coming from.  Was the salient subject causing me to feel so passionately, or was something deeper going on?</p>
    <p> Despite the fact that  the conversation went horribly wrong, and despite the fact that I behaved in a way that I am not completely proud of, I did learn something about myself from that situation. I learned that I should get a better grasp on my acutal feelings before engaging someone on a subject for which I feel strongly.  In retrospect, I think that if I'd told Charles that I felt opposed to his opinions because they were hurtful to me, the conversatoin might have gone differently(At least I hope). I think that if I'd been able to articulate what had actually been going on with me, we would have been able to have a more fruitful, productive and dialogic conversation.  Going forward, this conversation will always remind me to be honest in my interactions with others and to be honest within myself.</p>

    <h2>Okay, there's not really any subversion</h2>

    <p>Hey boots!  Let's learn about one of the most difficult topics I've yet encountered in my short career at DBC! Sound enticing? I bet it does.  Read on to find out about the awesomness of recursion!</p>

    <p>Recursion is a techniqe in computer programming wherein a function or method calls to itself to complete some task. In a lot of instances, the same tasks could be performed via iteration, but recursive functions provide a  more clean aesthetic--in the sense that these functions typically require fewer lines of code.  The downside to using recursive fucntions is that in some instances, they can take longer to perform the same tasks that a loop could do relatively quickly.</p>
    <p>In order for a recursive function to work properly, it has to have a bailout condition, otherwise the function will call to itself infinitely causing an infinite loop.  This will make any program crash. Check out the recursive method I've written below (in Ruby).  It demonstrates all that I've explained previously about recursive functions:  It loops, it calls to itself, and it has a bailout condtion.</p>

    <p>
    <code>array = (1..10).to_a</p>
    <p>p "Hello, your array is #{array.length} indeces long."</p>
    <p>p "We'll now call your recursive method."</p>

    <p>def recursive(array)</p>

    <p>  if array.length == 1</p>
    <p>    p "you've reached the end! Your array is now #{array.at(1)} index long."</p>
    <p>  else array.pop</p>
    <p>    p "you've taken index number #{array.length} away from your array."</p>
    <p>    recursive(array)</p>
    <p>  end</p>
    <p>end</code>
    </p>


  <p>When you call to <code>recursive(array)</code> in the console, the following is returned:</p>
  <p><img src="../images/t8-tech1.png"/></p>
  <p>Hopefully the console output demonstrates the process of this method.
  Some <a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/a-taste-of-recursion.html" target="_blank">authorities on the internet</a> agree that a useful time to implement a recursive function is when you're dealing with factorials.  Check out the other recursive method I've written in Ruby below:<p>
  <p>
  <code>def factorial(x)</p>
  <p> if x == 1</p>
  <p>  p "All done!"</p>
  <p> else</p>
  <p>  x = x * factorial(x-1)</p>
  <p> end</p>
  <p>return x</p>
  <p>end</code>
  </p>
  <p>The above method essentially decrements the parameter its passed (without express language telling it to like <code>--</code>) by virtue of the fact that it calls on itself on the parameter - 1. It stores the value of the parameter times the parmeter minus one, and then it calls on itself until the arguments reaches the break condition. This is the result of calling <code>factorial(5)</code> in the console:</p>

    <h1 class="blog" id="title_font">Stereotype Threat, Part II</h1>
    <h3 class="blog" id="date_font">November 2, 2014</h3>
     </div>

  <div class="blog" id="blog_entry">
    <p>This week we've been tasked with revisiting the topic of last week's Cultural Blog, <a>Stereotype Threat</a>. Check out the link for more information on that phenomenon.</p>
    <p>As a vehicle for further discussion on the subject, we've been asked to pick among an extensive list of values and write about why one's importance.  I've chosen to talk about courage</p>
    <p>There have been more times in my life than I'd like to acknowledge where I've felt that I've lacked courage in some situation or another. At those times I was never faced with a choice to perform an act of death-defying heroism, but you couldn't tell that to the anxiety that I felt at the prospect of behaving courageously. It could feel just that scary. With age, wisdom (and a realization that most of the time, I wouldn't actually risk getting punched in the face for standing up in certain situations) I've gotten over the fear to show courage. And the times when I've acted--to do what I believed was the right thing in a given situation--in spite of the fear, I've always felt immensley rewarded. I've felt rewarded when I've stood up for what I believed in.  I've felt rewarded when I've come to the assistance of others. Showing courage in the face of fear has enabled me to feel more connected to others and to feel proud of myself for doing what's felt like the right thing. </p>

    <h2>Values in My Life</h2>
    <p>The other values I chose for this blog entry follow.  The numbers that appear next to the values corresponds to a number range that indicates the degree to which I try to live up to the values with 1 = Disagree and 5 = Agree.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Security: 4</li>
      <li>Spirituality: 5</li>
      <li>Self-Knowledge: 5</li>
      <li>Stability: 4</li>
      <li>Helping Others: 5</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advice</h2>
    <p>I was recently talking with a friend about the general topic of "what's important in life." Having reached a point where we'd both worked hard for many years at thankless jobs, we'd both come to the realization that the really important things rarely involve the hours you've devoted to an employer that kept you away from friends and family.  She asked me about my decision to leave the legal profession, as she was contemplating a similar move. I told her about my decision to try DBC.
    <h2>Values and Stereotype Threat</h2>
    <p>I can only hope that my values will help me to navigate the unpleasant waters the Stereotype Threat can churn up.  I've worked pretty diligently for the past year to cultivate a more developed sense of self than I've had at previous stages in my life.  Practically, that usually just means acknowledging within myself that whatever I'm feeling is valid. The really tough part is being gentle with myself when the threat rears its head. Meditation has been super helpful with allowing me to give myself the space to self-validate. </p>

    <h2>differences between classes and constructor functions</h2>
    <h3 class="blog" id="date_font">November 2, 2014</h3>

    <p>This week's challenges in Phase 0 have introduced we new boots to JavaScript.  Like Ruby, JavaScript is an Object-Oriented programming language--for that reason, JavaScript felt eerily familiar to Ruby.  There are plenty of ways that JavaScript is not like Ruby, though, and this blog entry is dedicated to exploring one of those ways. So, without further adieu, let's talk about the differece between classes and constructor functions!</p>
    <p>Remember my blog entry on <a href="blog.html#W5Technical">Ruby Classes</a>? If not, take a look back.  In that entry I give an overview of what a class is, what it can contain and what it does. That blog entry does not talk about one important aspect of classs though--the relationship classes can share with one another called <a href="http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/ruby_inheritance.html">inheritance</a>. Ruby's inheritence feature allows classes to share information.  It's not a completely mutal form of sharing, though. In fact, it's called <a href="https://thenewcircle.com/static/bookshelf/ruby_tutorial/class_inheritance.html">single inheritance</a> and it means that only on class can inherit from another.</p>
    <p>What's all this got to do with JavaScript, you ask?  Well, JavaScript isn't a classist language.  That means it doesn't use a class structure to organize information.  It does use something that can perform essentially similar functions.  In fact, those structures  are actually called <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp">functions</a>.</p>
    <p>Like Classes in Ruby, functions in JavaScript can contain methods:</p>
    <p><code>function dog(name) {</code></p>
      <p><code>this.name = name;</code></p>
      <p><code>this.talk = function() {</code></p>
         <p><code> alert(this.name + " say woof!")</code></p>
     <p><code>}</code></p>
    <p><code>};</code></p>
    <caption>this code snippet was adapted from <a href="http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/oopjs2.shtml">javascriptkit</a></caption>
    <p>In the above snippet, <code>this.talk = function()</code> and the rest that follows in the curly braces is a method. If a new instance of dog were to be created, the #talk method would be available to be used on that new instance--just as you would expect when methods are defined within Ruby classes. In fact, new instances of <a href="http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/oopjs2.shtml">constructor functions</a> in JavaScript use a notation that is similar to Ruby's notation for creating new classes--that is the <strong>new</strong> operator.  Check this out:</p>
    <p><code>myDog = <strong>new</strong> dog("Ralphie");</code></p>

    <p>This creates a new instance of the dog function. This:</p>
    <p><code>bohemian_rhapsody = FreddieMercury.<strong>new</strong></code></p>

    <p>creates a new instance of the <code>FreddieMercury</code> class from <a href="blog.html#W5Technical">my previous post</a>.</p>

    <p>So now that we've looked a similarities, what about the differences?  Well, remember when I talked about inheritance a little earlier in this post? We already covered how inheritance in Ruby allows one class to share information with another. Here's an example of the notation that would allow for that:</p>

    <p><code> class Queen < FreddieMercury</code></p>

    <p>Using the above notation, we could allow our new class Queen access to all the attributes and methods available in FreddieMercury. However, in JavaScript it's not quite the same.  Remember, JavaScript doesn't actually have classes, so if we wanted to share information between objects we couldn't simply rely on the <code>></code> notation that we see in the above Ruby example.  We'd have to rely on JavaScript's <strong>prototyping</strong> functionality to share information. Let's use our <code>dog</code> function from above to demonstrate this. Say we wanted dog to be able to do more than just talk.  What if we wanted dog to be able to change it's name?  Let's take a look at another code example.

    <p><code>dog.<strong>prototype</strong>.changeName = function(name) {</code></p>
    <p><code>this.name = name;</code></p>
    <p><code>}</code></p>
    <p><caption>this code snippet was adapted from <a href="http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/oopjs2.shtml">javascriptkit</a></caption><p>

    <p>We've now added additional functionality to our <code>dog</code> function, such that if we were to create a new instance of dog with a name we didn't like, the method #changeName would be available to allow us to do just that! The <code>prototype</code> object that you see in bold above, allows the <code>dog</code> function to <strong>inherit</strong> the method <code>changeName</code>.  Are you wondering how this is at all like Ruby's class inheritance still? Good! You should be.  It turns out that in JavaScript, inheritence via the <code>prototype</code> object looks a heck of a lot like when we simply add methods directly to an existing class in Ruby. Therein lies the difference (somewhat).  In both languages there are express ways to share information between objects that contain other objects--the difference is in the way the objects themselves are structured and also the syntax used.</p>

              <p>This week's cultural blog entry is going to be tough, folks.  The topic is <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html" target = "_blank">Stereotype Threat</a> and for the majority of my life, I've known the feelings associated with this particular phenonmenon all too well. Le Sigh.  But let me get to giving you some background on exactly what this phenomenon is before we get into the heavy stuff, eh? </p>
              <p>So, this guy:</p>
              <img src="http://www.socialpsychology.org/thumb/4319/0/md.jpg"/>
              <p>is brilliant.  In fact, it's more than a little irreverent to refer to him as "this guy" as I do here as he is a preeminent academic who's published <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Steele#references" target="_blank">multiple peer-reviewd studies</a> and is known as the expert in this particular field of study.  His name is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Steele">Claude M. Steele</a> and for all intents an purposes, you can think of him as the man who proved that this phenomenon is real.</p>
              <p>So what is Stereotype Threat?  Well, I'll never be able to put is as eloquently as Prof. Steele, but based on notes I took from the articles I read in preparation for this blog entry, you can think of it this way: Stereotype Threat arises when an individual (or group of individuals) is in a situation where one of the negative stereotypes about her identity(ies) could be applied to her. The realization by that individual that she could be judged or reduced to nothing more than the stereotype is the threat. And often what occurs around this realization is a quantifiable interference with functioning on a number of levels.</p>
              <p>On the surface, it might seem like I'd qualify more as an outlier in regard to the demographic groups Prof. Steele's work has focused on.  Indeed--I am an African American woman who's acheived quite a bit of academic success in the span of my life; I've obtained two post-graduate degrees, and I successfully practiced criminal defense for a number of years before somewhat recently deciding to switch careers to another academically challenging profession.  But despite my "acheivements" that look pretty in print, I can tell you that there have been multiple times in my life (continuing through to the present) where I have felt Stereotype Threat acutely, and I have suffered because of it.</p>
              <p>One example that demonstrates my own experience with Stereotype Threat occurred when I first began my undergraduate studies. I attened a small, predominantly white, academically rigourous liberal arts college located in a suburb of Philadelphia.  When I got there, I expected to be surrounded by academics. I mean, I knew what the admission requirements were; obviously, as I'd gone through the process of applying myself. Yet, I could not anticipate how much my blackness and my womanhood would be interpreted as an explanation for perceived academic inferiority. And I was percieved as inferior a LOT.  This was somewhat attributable to the heavy, working-class black Baltimorean accent I had when I arrived.  If there are any fans of <a href="http://www.hbo.com/the-wire#/" target="blank">The Wire</a> out there, conjure to mind the character of <a href="http://www.hbo.com/the-wire#/the-wire/cast-and-crew/felicia-snoop-pearson/index.html" target="_blank">Snoop</a>, but take away most of the grittiness, and add a healthy dose of correct grammar (but not all correct) and you've got a good idea of what I sounded like when I started my freshman year.  People reacted to the way I talked overtly.  From good-natured ribbing about my frequent use of folk-idioms and backward country colloquialisms, to flat-out confusion about what I was actually saying, I knew right away that my accent was an issue for folks; they made it apparent to me constantly. But the accent was just the tip of the iceburg.  At first glance, it might seem almost too trivial of an example to try to demonstrate my experience with Stereotype Threat.  Afterall, I <strong>could</strong> have just masked my accent--which I eventually did--and be done with it.  But the accent was just a larger reflection of who I was and where I'd come from.  It's presence reinforced in the minds of others that I was different  from them.  I was different in a way that was incongruent with their ideas of intelligence. My accent confirmed that at least <strong>one</strong> stereotype about black people held true for me.  Afterall, black people speak differently from whites, right?  And if one black person is speaking in a way that's associated with "how black people speak" what else about them is just like "how black people are?" </p>
              <p>My blackness in combination with my womanhood often proved to be a much too potent mix for some during my college days (and beyond).  I wasn't allowed to be outwardly angry, lest I also be perceived as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angry_Black_Woman" target="_blank">angry black woman</a>.  The fact that I can provide a link to that phrase that will take you to more information (a Wikipedia article, no less!) about the subject, just confrms the pervasiveness of that stereotype. I was constantly preoccupied with whether my demeanor could have been perceived as overly aggressive for that reason.  Add to all this that I'm gay, and that I regularly have the  man-hater stereotype to contend with, and you can begin to see how this all becomes exhausting after a while.</p>
              <p>For a very long time I internalized my struggles with stereotypes.  Like the good "model minority" I've tried to be for so long, I would just put my head down and try to fight against the perception.  If someone thought my accent was too foreign, or too unfamiliar, I would change it.  If my demenor could be percieved as overly aggressive, I would calm it down to near vapidity.  Nowadays, though, I don't try to fight against stereotypes as much as I used to.  Admittedly, there's a large part of my stereotype struggle that's ingrained at this point, but I'm still aware of how much space stereotypes (and reacting to/against them in one way or another) take up in my life.  At DBC, I hope my awareness around these issues will help me articulate what's happening if I begin to feel the threat brewing. Hopefully, my experience can help others who've maybe dealt with this as well.  At the least, we could commiserate and reassure one another that we're not alone.</p>

              <p>Strap on your thinking caps, noobs! (or strap off your yawn caps as it were) because it's time for another edition of Dionne's DBC technical blog!  This week's topic falls squarely in the center of that ever-elusive subject of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" target="_blank">Object Orientated Programming</a>! Glance at the links--they're helpul! Specifically, this week I will be covering the topic of blocs, procs and lambdas.  Read on for your own edification:</p>
              <h3>Blocs</h3>
              <p>By now, if you've read any of my previous technical blog entries, you've probably encountered blocs or blocks many times. Blocks are <a href="http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/ruby_blocks.html" target="_blank">code blocks</a>--snippets of code that can be found between <code>{curly braces}</code> or <strong>do</strong> and <strong>end</strong> syntax.  Easy enough, right?  Take a look at these images:</p>
              <img src="../images/W6_curly_block_sublime.png"/>
              <p></p>
              <img src="../images/W6_block_do_end_sublime.png"/>
              <p>The above shot from my code editor shows a common method <code>#each</code> being called with code blocks that are formed between <code>{curly braces}</code> and between <strong>do</strong> and <strong>end</strong>. The reason to show both kinds of blocks is to demonstrate one coding convention in Ruby:  if your block is only going to take up one line of code, the convention is to use the <code>{curly braces}</code> otherwise, use <strong>do</strong> and <strong>end</strong> syntax. </p>

              <p>Here's some other useful things to remember about code blocks:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:circle; text-align:left">
                  <li>If you're associating a block with a method, it must always appear to the right of the method</li>
                  <li>If you declare a variable for the first time within a code block, you will only be able to access it there. </li>
                  <li>A code block is not actually an object in Ruby. Thus its not a really useful form for repeating tasks </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In combination with methods, code blocks are super useful for executing bits of code in singular situations.  When we want to be able to access the functionality of a block multiple times, we turn to the other subjects of today's post: Procs and Lambdas </p>

              <h3>Procs</h3>
              <p>Let's start this section of with an image, shall we?</p>
              <img src="../images/W6_proc_sublime.png"/>
              <p>Here's the results of that code in the console:"</p>"
              <img src="../images/W6_proc_console.png" />
              <p><a href="http://www.reactive.io/tips/2008/12/21/understanding-ruby-blocks-procs-and-lambdas/" target="_blank">Reactive IO</a> has a sweet and succint explanation of Procs or <strong>Procedures</strong>, which is essentially the following: </p>
              <blockquote cite="http://www.reactive.io/tips/2008/12/21/understanding-ruby-blocks-procs-and-lambdas/">We may want to have many different blocks at our disposal and use them multiple times. As such, passing the same block again and again would require us to repeat ourself[sic]. However, as Ruby is fully object-oriented, this can be handled quite cleanly by saving reusable code as an object itself. This reusable code is called a Proc (short for procedure). The only difference between blocks and Procs is that a block is a Proc that cannot be saved, and as such, is a one time use solution.</blockquote>

              <p>In the above image, the Proc (and it's usefulness) can be seen beginning on the line that includes <code>Proc.new</code>. Do you see how the Proc is assigned to a variable, and how that variable is used multiple times?  This is awesome, right!? Procs provide a way to "objectify" blocks.  They make it such that blocks can be accessed again and again.  (Note to invoke your Proc, you use the (&variable_name) notation.)

              <h3>Lambdas</h3>
              <p>Last, but not least are Lambdas.  On first glance, Lambdas look very similar to procs:</p>
              <img src="../images/W6_lamda_sublime.png" />
              <p>Here's this code in the console:</p>
              <img src="../images/W6_lambda_console.png" />
              <p>Indeed, in the above image, we're taking what looks like a regular old code block and we're assigning it to a variable just like we did with Procs above. Further down, we  reference the variable more than once. Still similar to Procs, right?  The most obvious difference between the two is the notation for how they're formed--with Procs requiring <code>Proc.new</code> and lamdas simply being declared and followed by the code block we wish to repeat.</p>
              <p>But there's more to it than that! Helpful Ruby Blogger Alan Skorkin wrote a dream explanation for noobs on the differences between Procs and Lamdas.  You can find it <a href="http://www.skorks.com/2010/05/ruby-procs-and-lambdas-and-the-difference-between-them/#difference" target="_blank">here</a> Becase this blog is both a learning process for you and for me, dear reader, I'll try to explain Mr. Skorkin's assessment in my own words.  Ahem:</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, the two are very similar, but they treat control flow differently.  Certain keywords that are essential to flow such as <code>return</code> and <code>break</code> behave differently within each of these block-saving objects.</p>

    <p>DBC is big on feedback. And when I say big, I mean <strong>BIG</strong> caps and bold are completely necessary to this description, folks. As a part of our curriculum (off-site phase included), we're required engage in all kinds of feedback acivity--whether giving or receiving. And this requirement is not some loosey-goosey, touch-feely exercise in futility, either.  The amount of feedback we contribute to the overall process factors directly into whether DBC feels we're progressing.  It's that big of a deal.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, I think constructive feeback is a super useful tool for assessing onself throughout any learning process, but in this world of ever-pervasive internet anonymity (not in the anonymity-doesn't-exist-on-the-internets-just-ask-Edward-Snowden kind of way, more like the ubiquitous-and-polarizing-anonymous-rants-in-the-comments-section-of-your-local-news-site kind of way) it's decidely unsettling at times to know that comments you make about folks will be accessible to them--and this is even taking into consideration DBC's policy on anonymous <a href="http://vimeo.com/99780302">A.S.K</a> feedback.</p>

    <p>Unsettling feelings notwithstanding, this feedback process has been predominantly positive for me. It's been like having someone hold up a mirror that reflects the dynamics that factor into how I problem-solve and work with others.  Don't mistake the positive feelings that I've taken away to mean that all of my feedback was awesome and easy to take, because that's not necessarily the case. Whenever anyone is shown a figurative mirror of oneself in any context, it's guaranteed that some of what's seen is gonna be cringe-worthy.   I just feel that I've grown from having received feedback in this context, b/c I have faith that every person who's left feedback for me, has taken it as seriously as I have when leaving feedback for others. And I have really taken it seriousely. </p>

    <p>It hasn't always been easy to leave feedback.  I've had a couple of pairing sessions where aspects my peronality just didn't jibe well with my pairing partner. In the end, those sessions felt less-than productive b/c our clashing personalities became a distraction--at least for me.  When those sessions were over, I was really nervous to leave honest feedback for a myriad of reasons. I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings, and besides, had I really accurately assessed those situations?   Ultimately, I decided I had to be honest.  If I really wanted to grow from this process,  I would have to fully partipate in both giving and receiving feedback b/c to do so was to be honest--honest with oneself and honest with others.  Honesty is one of the best vehicles through which to progress and grow, I think.</p>

    <p>Going forward, the collaborative process of peer-pairing may not always go swimmingly.  I don't expect every session to be sunshine and rainbows, afterall.  But the lens I've developed via the feedback I've recieved has definitely helped put peer pariing into perspective.  The first few nerve-wracking times are behind me--but the lessons my partners and I learned via fumbling through problems together have made the pairing sessions to come seem more than surmountable.   </p>

    <p>Whaddup, Ruby Noobs?  In this edition of my DBC technical blog, I am tasked with teaching you a bit about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)" target="_blank">classes</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure" target="_blank">data structures</a>. Read on to treat yourself to some knowlege:</p>
    <img src="../images/treat_yo_self.gif" />

    <p>So, if you bothered to read the embedded links I provided in my introductory sentence, (which, I can't fault you if you didn't) you would've come across two somewhat long, but rather approachable <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> articles on those subjects.  Cool right?  It's my hope that this blog post will be at least as approachable as those artices, with the added benefit of being exponentially shorter.  So to begin, at it's most basic, a data structure is a way to organize information in a computer.  There's not just one data structure;  oh no, there are many different kinds whose organization may be particularly suited for one kind of data retrieval or another, depending.</p>
    <p> A real world example that comes to mind that might help to conceptualize the idea of data strutures is a flow-chart--especially ones that assist with binary decision-making.  Take this example:</p>
    <img src = "../images/mercury_flowchart.jpg"/>
    <p>Flow chart brought to you courtesy of <a href="http://blobsite.net/tag/freddie-mercury/">blobsite.net</a>

    <p>If you were tasked with the decision of organizing Freddie Mercury's wants in a format that's easily retrievable by a computer, you might do so by organizing them into a data structure called a hash, like so:</p>
    <img src="../images/mercury_hash.png" />
    <p>If you don't remember what a hash is, it's cool.  Just check out <a href="" target="_blank">my previous blog post</a> on the subject. "But, Dionne," you say "isn't there also an <a href="" target="_blank">array</a> in that mess of code you just posted?" You're correct, dear reader.  There's also an array at the first key's value.  And if you remember from my <a href="" target="_blank">post</a> an array's also a data structure. It's particularly useful in this hash because Freddie Mercury has a lot of wants.  Having his wants organized into a separate structure just makes them easier to access, as you'll see in a bit.</p>

    <h3>So, Where do Classes Come in to All of This?</h3>

    <p>Well, classes have some similarities to data structures, in the sense that they organize information.  Unlike data structures though, classes can contain more than just raw data.  Let's get back to our Freddie Mercury example from earlier.  Look at this code: </p>

    <code>
      <pre>
      class FreddieMercury

        def initialize
         @freddie_Mercury = {
            "wants" => ["to break free","to ride his bicycle",
            "it all now", "to make a supersonic man outta you"],
            "doesnt_want" => "you to stop him now",
            "isnt_sure" => "live forever"
          }

          things = rand(0..@freddie_Mercury["wants"].length-1)
          @wants = @freddie_Mercury["wants"][things]
          @doesnt_want = @freddie_Mercury["doesnt_want"]
          @isnt_sure = @freddie_Mercury["isnt_sure"]

          p "Does Freddie Mercury want #{@wants}? Y/N?"
          self.get_input
        end

        def get_input
          @answer = gets.chomp.upcase.to_s
          self.check
        end

        def check

          if @answer == "N"
            p "The only thing Freddie Mercury doesn't want is for #{@doesnt_want}."
          elsif @answer == "Y"
            p "Okay. You know Freddie Mercury."
          else
            p "Freddie Mercury isn't sure if he wants to #{@isnt_sure}.
            I'm not sure what letters you entered. Y/N?"
            self.get_input
          end

        end
        end
      </pre>
    </code>

    <p>Above, I've created a class called <code>FreddieMercury</code>.  See that capitalization? It's an important naming convention that follows best practices with regard to classes in Ruby.  You can also see that my <code>FreddieMercury</code> class contains the hash we talked about earlier. The class also contains other things--and the function of those other things is what makes classes special.</p>

    <p>See all that code up there that begins and ends with <code>def</code> and <code>end</code>?  Those are called methods. Methods tell a computer to actually <strong>do</strong> something to the object the method is called on. In the case of my code, my <code>#get_input</code> method retrieves information from a user and my <code>#check</code> method measures that input against the hash I've stored in my <code>FreddieMercury</code> class. When methods are inside of classes like <code>FreddieMercury</code> those methods can be used on objects that are in the class. If I'd made a different class, for example, a class called <code>LisaLeftEyeLopez</code> I wouldn't be able to use my <code>FreddieMercury</code> methods (unless I imported those methods, but that's a subject for a different blog entry).</p>
    <p>Look again at <code>FreddieMercury</code>. Do you also see the code that's prefaced by the <code>@</code> symbol?  You might recognize how that code functions within the methods if you look closely. Those are variables, and that special <code>@</code> notation makes them available throughout the class; they're called instance variables and all the methods in the class can access them.</p>

    <p>What about that <code>#initialize</code> business, that's at the very beginning of the class?  Whelp, any time you create or <strong>define</strong> a class, you've gotta intialize it.  Initialization makes the class (and all the things within the class) accessible to a programmer. The notation to bring about a new instance of a class is <code>Class.new</code> </p>

    <p>Now, it's all fine and well to talk about how to make a class, what a class contains, and how to make a class accessible, but what <strong>is</strong> a class exactly? Well, check out some of the examples on <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby-for-newbies-working-with-classes--net-15938" target="_blank">this</a> great Ruby tutorial page. Compare those example that to the examples I've included above, and I think you'll have a good introduction into this programming concept.</p>

    <p>P.S.  Any idea what my <code>FreddieMercury</code> does?  Run it in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell" target="_blank">IRB</a> to find out!</p>

    <p>I'd be lying if I said that researching for <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com">DBC</a>'s cultural blog assignment this week was the first time I'd ever heard of gender imbalance in the tech community.  It's not.  I don't think that it's any secret to anyone who isn't even directly involved in the tech industry; a look at pop culture makes this apparent.  I think everyone's familar with the stereotype of the under-exposed, highly intelligent male computer whiz. That particular archetype has been present in movies and on TV for years now.  And although we've had female analogs--Angelina Jolie in Hackers comes to mind--the stereotype of the male computer expert persists.</p>

    <p>Most folks who've been around on this great green earth for a while can readily admit--for good or for bad--that stereotypes are often informed from reality in one way or another.  And in this case, the stereotype of the male computer whiz directly reflects the reality of the gender makeup of the tech industry.  It's male-dominated world.  And it can often be an unwelcoming and inhospitable place for women who dare venture inside.</p>

    <p>There's been a slew of articles recently about women in tech witnessing (and oftentimes being the target of) abhorrent gender-focused conduct from their male counterparts. Indeed, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/07/01/tinder_sexual_harassment_suit_former_executive_claims_she_was_called_a_whore.html">Tinder</a>, <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/every-fucked-up-text-from-the-tinder-sexual-harassment-1598642609">SnapChat</a>, <a href="http://www.thefrisky.com/2013-10-09/this-sexist-flier-was-spotted-in-the-ladies-bathroom-at-twitters-headquarters/">Twitter</a> and even <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/">Github</a> have all had highly-publicized instances of sexism and harassment revealed to the public at large</p>

    <p>As a woman transitioning (hopefully) to a career in tech, I find these stories troubling.  Having come from a profession that was male-dominated and that could, at times, feel like a boy's club of sorts, I know how painful, exhausting and frustrating facing down gender-bias can be. I can only hope that the fact that recent statistics on women who pursue STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) degrees will mean a huge influx of women in this industry is coming and is coming fast.  Ultimately, I know my presence--and the presence of all the other women in DBC cohorts near and far--will be a step in the right direction.  A step toward gender equality.</p>

          <p>This week's technical blog focuses on Ruby's Enumerable module.  What's a module, you ask?  Well let me tell you, because I just found out myself when researching to write this blog.  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/8192/scottru">This dude</a> was kind enough to answer that question a long time ago on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/151505/difference-between-a-class-and-a-module">Stack Overflow</a> so, I'll just drop his well-worded answer below for your consumption:</p>
          <p class="block_quote">Modules are about providing methods that you can use across multiple classes - think about them as "libraries" (as you would see in a Rails app). Classes are about objects; modules are about functions.</p>
          <p>In Ruby, the Enumerable module is pretty awesome.  It can be used with any of the  <a href="http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/collections/">collections classes</a>.  For noobs like you and me, that means any of the classes that can that can have .each called on them. The Enumerable module supplies about 20 useful counting an iteration-related methods to the classes it can be used with.</p>
          <h4>Enumerable#cycle: The real focus of this blog entry</h4>
          <p>Okay, so in truth, this blog entry was supposed to focus on only one of the methods made available by the Enumerable module.  I just felt that I'd be leaving out a lot of background information if I just jumped in to explaining the method.  Now that you have the background, let's talk about Enumerable#cycle!</p>
          <p>#cycle is a method that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration#Computing">iterates</a>.  It can accept a single, positive integer as an argument, abd that integer will tell it how many times it should iterate.  #cycle can also accept <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(programming)">a code block</a>.  If a code block is supplied with no argument, #cycle will iterate infinitely.  Check out this example I made using my code editor:</p>
          <p><img src="../images/w4tb_sublime1.png" /></p>
          <p>Here, I've used #cycle to iterate over the array I created called my_array. I've passed it the parameter of 2--which tells it that it should iterate over my_array two times and execute the supplied code block.  Here's the results in my console: </p>
          <p><img src="../images/w4tb_console1.png"/></p>
          <p>As you can see, #cycle caused the each of the integers in the array to multiplied by two, and returned to the console twice.</p>
          <p>Now, #cycle is nondestructive.  For Ruby noobs, this just means that this method doesn't acutally make changes to the array it iterates over.  A really interesting use of this method comes when you use it to puts the next item in a repeating sequence. The good folks over at <a href="http://www.globalnerdy.com/2008/07/06/enumerating-enumerable-enumerablecycle/">Global Nerdy</a> to an awesome job of explaining just how this works, but I've gone ahead and demonstrated this in my own code editor and console:</p>
          <p><img src="../images/w4tb_sublime2.png" /></p>
          <p>Above, you can see that I've assigned the variable <code>each_element</code>to the object formed by calling #cylce on an array. I then puts <code>each_element.next</code> three times and this it what returns to my console:</p>
          <p><img src="../images/w4tb_console2.png"/></p>
          <p>Each element in the original array is returned to the console in sequence. Pretty neat huh? Now, we can't just ignore the <code>.next</code> method I also used.  Check out the ruby documentation for more information on what this does--although, I think it's probably pretty obvious.  Even to a noob!</p>

        <div class="blog" id="blog_entry">
          <p>Many moons ago in August of this year, I undertook the task of assessing my learning and thinking styles in anticipation of my admission into <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com" "target=_blank">DBC</a>.  I have to admit that going into the test, I expected to know it's outcome.  I mean, you don't live for 35 years and go to school for way too many of those years without thinking you know your academic self, right?  I also thought that my results would be easily gleaned by the nature of the question, themselves. Sort of like those cheesy magazine quizzes in that supposedly gauge your personality.</p>
          <p>Whelp, all this build-up I've written before actually getting to my results can only mean one thing.  I was super surprised at what the test revealed about me.  Apparently, I fall into the category of an <a href="" target="_blank">Abstract Sequential</a> thinker:</p>
          <p><img src="../images/abstract_Sequential.png" /></p>
          <p>Per the information in the handy-dandy chart I've included above (originally found <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" target="_blank">here</a>), I'm a lot less rigid in the way I approach learning than I thought I was.  Additional research on the subject of my learning style only convinced me that the test was real.  <a href="http://child-1st.typepad.com/my_weblog/2010/05/the-abstract-sequential-learning-style.html" target="_blank">This</a> article by a parent of an Abstract Sequential child really resonated with me.  I saw so many similarities between the way I actually know myself to be as a student, and the way the author's daughter was. It was really illuminating.</p>
          <p>Knowing more about my style of learning will, hopefully, benefit me while at DBC. First and foremost, I hope that this knowledge will help me to avoid becoming frustrated when situations fall outside of my learning "comfort-zone." I also hope this knowledge will enable me to be able to clearly articulate my needs to both my peers and my instructors in order to facilitate the best learning environment possible. </p>
          <p> I can already see how my learning style has impacted my experience in Phase 0 thus far. Specifically, I experienced the typical Abstract Sequential reaction to feeling rushed (or feeling that there is not enough time to complete a task at hand) during these past couple of weeks. In week 2 in particular, I felt really strapped for time.  This was due mostly to the fact that life happens. That particular week I had a convergence of responsibilites to attend events, and caring for a physically ill person on top of my full-time job and work due for DBC. I can only hope during DBC, I won't have to deal with outside events vying for my time. Nevertheless, I already know that the workload for DBC will be intense. In anticipation of that, I plan to try my utmost to be present within myself as much and as often as I can.  I plan to have self check ins wherein I attempt to notice whether I'm getting overwhelmed to the point of shutting down.</p>
          <p>Another aspect of the Abstract Sequential learning style that might prove difficult for me is group work that required me to collaborated with others of  differing views. When I read that description of an Abstract Sequential's characteristics, I felt that it was so true of me.  In the past, soometimes it has been somewhat difficult for me to acutally understand other people's approaches to learning.  In anticipation of all the group work we'll be doing in DBC, I will just have to keep reminding myself that not everyone learns the same.  Knowing this has already made me have some insight into some of the pairing sessions that I've had thus far.</p>
          <h4>Growth and Fixed Mindset and Their Interplay with my Learning Style.</h4>
          <p>During the Phase 0 prerequisite phase, when we firt had to research <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/" target="_blank">Growth & Fixed Mindset</a>, I immediately saw the ways that I've stifled my own learning by placing heavy importance on fixed mindset principles--I've focused on the outcomes of learning rather than the process; I've been reward-focused in learning; I've learned for grades, not for personal edification. Being aware of all these things will help me stay on top of the stuff that can creep up and impede learning and growth, I think. </p>

          <div class="blog" id="blog_entry">
            <p>Alright, noobs.  It's time to put your coding caps on 'cuz were about to learn about  some programming concepts. Read on to find my attempt at describing the ever-elusive subject of Arrays and Hashes.  </p>
            <h4>Arrays and Hashes: What are they? Why are you telling me this?</h4>
            <p>At their most basic, arrays and hashes are things.  That's right, I said things.  To the more erudite among us, Hashes and Arrays can be formally described as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure" target="_blank">data structures</a>, but I assume that if you're reading this blog entry, you're a noob like me and you may or may not have an idea of what a data structure is.  So, let's just keep it simple.  Arrays and Hashes are things--things that store other things. That clear it up?  No? I didn't think so.  </p>
            <p>It might help to think of Arrays and Hashes like tupperware containers made of code.  Like tupperware, Hashes and Arrays can contain itemsâ€”unlike tupperware those items aren't leftovers no one wants.  Indeed, the items they store are called objects.  But because we're all noobs here, and because the idea of objects can get a wee bit complicated when you're just learning about all of this, let's just say that Hashes and Arrays store information.  Better? I thought so.</p>
            <p>Now, Hashes and Arrays can both can store the same type of information, whether strings like “hey you!” or integers like 9--they just differ in their rules of construction and they way they store that information.  Arrays are more rigid--any object you store in an array is going to be indexed by an ordered integer list.  What?  Okay, simple.  Just think of it like this: any information you put in an array will be assigned a number--just like a numbered list.  Except this list begins with zero.    Look at this chart I made.  I hope it makes what I'm trying o say more clear:</p>
            <p><img src="../images/array_Chart.png" /></p>
            <p>I placed the the string “zero” in the first position of my array.  Because of how arrays work, the string “zero”was assigned the number zero.  Don't get it confused though, I could've placed any string in the array and it would've been assigned an integer regardless of what the string was.  You can see that more clearly with the string “peanut butter” which has been assigned the integer 2, because "peanut butterâ€ was the third object placed in my array.  Remember arrays begin they're number assignment at 0.</p>
            <p>Now,  hashes let you store information based on an arbitrary assignment of a value.  Does that sound too computery?  Just look at the hash chart I made to elucidate what I mean:</p>
            <p><img src="../images/hash_Chart.png" /></p>
            <p>In a hash you can place any information you want.  Unlike arrays, hashes don't assign an integer to correspond to the information you've placed within it.  Hashes understand what you put in them as key/value pairs.  So in the chart above, all my keys are names of people.  All my values are associated with those people somehow.  It just so happens that all of the information in my hash above take the form of strings.  But because you can put any object in a hash, the information doesn't have to be a string.  It can be anything!</p>
            <h4>This stuff sounds awesome.  How can I make a Hash?  How can I make an Array?</h4>
            <p>To make array, here's the syntax.  </p>
            <p>array = [ ]  or  array = Array.new( )</p>
            <p>Those commands create and empty arrays. If you want to create an array with information (objects) already in it, you just have to place the information/objects in between the brackets like so:</p>
            <p><img src="../images/mic_Check_Array.png" /></p>
            <p>With  a little finagling (that we won't get into now)  we  could get the above array to return the following to our console:</p>
            <p><img src="../images/mic_Check_Console.png" /></p>
            <p>To make a hash, here's the syntax:</p>
            <p>hash = {} or hash = Hash.new()</p>
            <p>Like the example with arrays above, that creates an empty hash.  If you want to create a hash with information in it already, you can use the following syntax:</p>
            <p><img src="../images/phife_dawg_Hash.png" /></p>
            <p>Again, through the magic of Ruby, you could get the following to show up in the console:</p>
            <p><img src="../images/phife_Dawg_Console.png" /></p>
            <h4>So if they both store information, why do they both exist? Is one better than the other? </h4>
            <p>Now, because I'm a noob myself, and because my experience with / exposure to Arrays and Hashes has been somewhat limited, I honestly struggle a bit with an explanation here.  Hashes are more flexible, obviously, because a developer's not limited to the way information is stored within them.   According to <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/guide-ruby-collections-part-arrays/ ">this article</a>arrays are efficient workhorses that are ubiquitous in ruby. Either way, they're both super-useful to allow information to be stored and accessed at will.  Thus they're both essential concepts to understand in your journey to be a developer, dear noob!</p>

            <h2>A Noob's Take on the Culture of DBC</h2>
            <h3 class="blog" id="date_font">September 20, 2014</h3></div>
          <div id="line_break"></div>
<!--Actual Blog entry goes below this line-->
          <div class="blog" id="blog_entry">
            <p>I just finished watching a large portion of DBC founder Shereef Bishay's fireside chat, and I really have to say that I'm drinking the Kool-Aid, guys.  Word. This, despite the fact that Karim Bishay expressly stated that DBC isn't asking for that in the pre-phase 0 prep Emotional Intelligence video. Oh, yeaaahh! Haha.</p>
           <p>Joking aside, I was really glad to have watched Shereef's chat; it covered a lot of questions I'd been thinking of prior to watching. The biggest thing I've taken away from the chat--and all of the pre-Phase 0 and Phase 0 work--is that i'm really digging the culture of DBC. I don't mean to sound corny, but it feels like this is the right fit.</p>
            <p>By way of an example, I've engaged in meditation practice on and off for the last year or so.  Recently, my practice has been more off than on--I'm sad to admit--nevertheless, I constantly strive to be present within myself and within social situations.  So, when Karim talked about being present within the context of giving and receiving feedback, that really resonated with me. When Shereef talked about fostering a collaborative environment, that resonated too.  My previous professional environment was so different from all of this.  As a criminal defense attorney, I lived everyday in an a predominantly antagnositc and adversarial world. And honestly, a little part of me felt like it was dying then. DBC feels more like the environment I should have been in; one that fosters creativity and that encourages sharing and openness. This is what I've been looking for.</p>
            <p>Don't get me wrong, I can't pretend I'm coming into this all awe and no fear. I'm scared shitless, guys. I am.  I'm scared of looking stupid.  I'm scared of being vulnerable enough to be okay with saying I'm wrong.  I'm scared of failing.  I'm just heartened that at DBC it seems that it's really okay to be scared and it's really okay to be wrong, and it sounds like DBC is really invested in each of us NOT failing.</p>
           <p>Anyway, that's my little take on this.  I'm really excited to meet everyone at DBC. Just counting down the days until Nov 17th, now!</p></div>

          <div class="blog" id="blog_entry">
            <p>We've touched on many concepts that were new to me in this first week of DBC Phase 0, and I'd like to take a little bit of time to explain some of them in a way that's accessible and hopefully easy to understand.</p>
            <p>Below you'll find my attempt to do just that on the topic of version control and, relatedly, on how git and Github track changes and stores code.</p>
            <h4>Version Control: What is it?</h4>
            <p>Stated (hopefully) simply, version control is  is a process of file management that allows a user to make multiple edits on a file without fear of changing or destroying the original.  Each and every edit can be saved during this process, allowing a user to revisit any former iteration of the file.  It's perhaps most easy to think of it like a save point in a video game. A user has the option to save everything she did up to a point and revisit that specific point whenever she wants.</p>
            <h4>Why is Version Control beneficial?</h4>
            <p>Multiple save points are beneficial because a user never has to fear making changes. She won't have to worry that a change will destroy something she's spent hours creating because, provided that she's saved along the way, she'll be able to revisit any past verison of the file she wants. Within the coding context, this is super helpful.  Code can go through many iterations before the final version.  Using version control, a coder can make edits on a discrete part of the code and test to how that change works within the whole without fear that anything will be destroyed.</p>
            <h4>git and Version Control:  How git helps you Track Changes.</h4>
            <p>Within the git platform, version control is easy to implement. All git folders are tracked folders. What that means is that whenever a user makes a change to a file within a git-tracked folder, git detects it.  A user can check the status of a file's changes by entering "git status" (without the quotes) on the command line from within the appropriate directory. Git will return information about the file's status--from whether it's been modified or whether there's been no changes.</p>
            <p>Once a file has been modified, a user can decide to save--or commit--those changes using the following series of commands:</p>
            <br>git add [file]
            <br>git commit -m "[message about the changes made]"
            <br>git push orgin master
            <br>git add [file] tells git that the user is ready to commit the file--or save the changes made.
            <br>git commit -m "[message]" allows the user to enter a short message about the specific changes to the file.
            <p>Finally, "git push origin master" (again without quotes) "pushes" the changes to the file to the user's remote repository (we haven't covered the meaning of this within this blog post yet--but suffice it to say, a remote repository is like a folder hosted on a server outside the local computer)</p>
            <p>If a user wants to see the entire history of a file's changes, she can enter "git log" (no quotes) on the command line.  This will return the commit number, the author's name, the date and time of the modification and the commit message.</p>
            <h4>GitHub.  What is it?</h4>
            <p>Github is an online platform that allows git users to upload and share files via the site's remote repositories. Not only can users of Github see all versions of any of the uploaded files uploaded to the repositories, but they can also actively make changes on other users' files and submit proposed changes for incorporation, or merging.</p>
            <h4>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h4>
            <p>GitHub has a large and active online community of coders, many of whom are committed to improving code through collaboration. GitHub's remote repositories encourage collaborative work; all members can access other users' public repositories and submit changes to existing files. There is a review process before any changes are incorporated--or merged, however, so there's no fear that one user's changes will overwrite another's. This can allow multiple individuals to work on the same files without destroying the original. In sum, GitHub is a great platform that's collaboration-friendly.</p>
