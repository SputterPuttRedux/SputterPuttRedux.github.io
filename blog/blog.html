    <p>I'd be lying if I said that researching for <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com">DBC</a>'s cultural blog assignment this week was the first time I'd ever heard of gender imbalance in the tech community.  It's not.  I don't think that it's any secret to anyone who isn't even directly involved in the tech industry; a look at pop culture makes this apparent.  I think everyone's familar with the stereotype of the under-exposed, highly intelligent male computer whiz. That particular archetype has been present in movies and on TV for years now.  And although we've had female analogs--Angelina Jolie in Hackers comes to mind--the stereotype of the male computer expert persists.</p>

    <p>Most folks who've been around on this great green earth for a while can readily admit--for good or for bad--that stereotypes are often informed from reality in one way or another.  And in this case, the stereotype of the male computer whiz directly reflects the reality of the gender makeup of the tech industry.  It's male-dominated world.  And it can often be an unwelcoming and inhospitable place for women who dare venture inside.</p>

    <p>There's been a slew of articles recently about women in tech witnessing (and oftentimes being the target of) abhorrent gender-focused conduct from their male counterparts. Indeed, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/07/01/tinder_sexual_harassment_suit_former_executive_claims_she_was_called_a_whore.html">Tinder</a>, <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/every-fucked-up-text-from-the-tinder-sexual-harassment-1598642609">SnapChat</a>, <a href="http://www.thefrisky.com/2013-10-09/this-sexist-flier-was-spotted-in-the-ladies-bathroom-at-twitters-headquarters/">Twitter</a> and even <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/">Github</a> have all had highly-publicized instances of sexism and harassment revealed to the public at large</p>

    <p>As a woman transitioning (hopefully) to a career in tech, I find these stories troubling.  Having come from a profession that was male-dominated and that could, at times, feel like a boy's club of sorts, I know how painful, exhausting and frustrating facing down gender-bias can be. I can only hope that the fact that recent statistics on women who pursue STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) degrees will mean a huge influx of women in this industry is coming and is coming fast.  Ultimately, I know my presence--and the presence of all the other women in DBC cohorts near and far--will be a step in the right direction.  A step toward gender equality.</p>

          <div class="blog" id="blog_entry">
          <p>This week's technical blog focuses on Ruby's Enumerable module.  What's a module, you ask?  Well let me tell you, because I just found out myself when researching to write this blog.  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/8192/scottru">This dude</a> was kind enough to answer that question a long time ago on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/151505/difference-between-a-class-and-a-module">Stack Overflow</a> so, I'll just drop his well-worded answer below for your consumption:</p>
          <p class="block_quote">Modules are about providing methods that you can use across multiple classes - think about them as "libraries" (as you would see in a Rails app). Classes are about objects; modules are about functions.</p>
          <p>In Ruby, the Enumerable module is pretty awesome.  It can be used with any of the  <a href="http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/collections/">collections classes</a>.  For noobs like you and me, that means any of the classes that can that can have .each called on them. The Enumerable module supplies about 20 useful counting an iteration-related methods to the classes it can be used with.</p>
          <h4>Enumerable#cycle: The real focus of this blog entry</h4>
          <p>Okay, so in truth, this blog entry was supposed to focus on only one of the methods made available by the Enumerable module.  I just felt that I'd be leaving out a lot of background information if I just jumped in to explaining the method.  Now that you have the background, let's talk about Enumerable#cycle!</p>
          <p>#cycle is a method that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration#Computing">iterates</a>.  It can accept a single, positive integer as an argument, abd that integer will tell it how many times it should iterate.  #cycle can also accept <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(programming)">a code block</a>.  If a code block is supplied with no argument, #cycle will iterate infinitely.  Check out this example I made using my code editor:</p>
          <p><img src="../images/w4tb_sublime1.png" /></p>
          <p>Here, I've used #cycle to iterate over the array I created called my_array. I've passed it the parameter of 2--which tells it that it should iterate over my_array two times and execute the supplied code block.  Here's the results in my console: </p>
          <p><img src="../images/w4tb_console1.png"/></p>
          <p>As you can see, #cycle caused the each of the integers in the array to multiplied by two, and returned to the console twice.</p>
          <p>Now, #cycle is nondestructive.  For Ruby noobs, this just means that this method doesn't acutally make changes to the array it iterates over.  A really interesting use of this method comes when you use it to puts the next item in a repeating sequence. The good folks over at <a href="http://www.globalnerdy.com/2008/07/06/enumerating-enumerable-enumerablecycle/">Global Nerdy</a> to an awesome job of explaining just how this works, but I've gone ahead and demonstrated this in my own code editor and console:</p>
          <p><img src="../images/w4tb_sublime2.png" /></p>
          <p>Above, you can see that I've assigned the variable <code>each_element</code>to the object formed by calling #cylce on an array. I then puts <code>each_element.next</code> three times and this it what returns to my console:</p>
          <p><img src="../images/w4tb_console2.png"/></p>
          <p>Each element in the original array is returned to the console in sequence. Pretty neat huh? Now, we can't just ignore the <code>.next</code> method I also used.  Check out the ruby documentation for more information on what this does--although, I think it's probably pretty obvious.  Even to a noob!</p>

          <p>Many moons ago in August of this year, I undertook the task of assessing my learning and thinking styles in anticipation of my admission into <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com" "target=_blank">DBC</a>.  I have to admit that going into the test, I expected to know it's outcome.  I mean, you don't live for 35 years and go to school for way too many of those years without thinking you know your academic self, right?  I also thought that my results would be easily gleaned by the nature of the question, themselves. Sort of like those cheesy magazine quizzes in that supposedly gauge your personality.</p>
          <p>Whelp, all this build-up I've written before actually getting to my results can only mean one thing.  I was super surprised at what the test revealed about me.  Apparently, I fall into the category of an <a href="" target="_blank">Abstract Sequential</a> thinker:</p>
          <p><img src="../images/abstract_Sequential.png" /></p>
          <p>Per the information in the handy-dandy chart I've included above (originally found <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" target="_blank">here</a>), I'm a lot less rigid in the way I approach learning than I thought I was.  Additional research on the subject of my learning style only convinced me that the test was real.  <a href="http://child-1st.typepad.com/my_weblog/2010/05/the-abstract-sequential-learning-style.html" target="_blank">This</a> article by a parent of an Abstract Sequential child really resonated with me.  I saw so many similarities between the way I actually know myself to be as a student, and the way the author's daughter was. It was really illuminating.</p>
          <p>Knowing more about my style of learning will, hopefully, benefit me while at DBC. First and foremost, I hope that this knowledge will help me to avoid becoming frustrated when situations fall outside of my learning "comfort-zone." I also hope this knowledge will enable me to be able to clearly articulate my needs to both my peers and my instructors in order to facilitate the best learning environment possible. </p>
          <p> I can already see how my learning style has impacted my experience in Phase 0 thus far. Specifically, I experienced the typical Abstract Sequential reaction to feeling rushed (or feeling that there is not enough time to complete a task at hand) during these past couple of weeks. In week 2 in particular, I felt really strapped for time.  This was due mostly to the fact that life happens. That particular week I had a convergence of responsibilites to attend events, and caring for a physically ill person on top of my full-time job and work due for DBC. I can only hope during DBC, I won't have to deal with outside events vying for my time. Nevertheless, I already know that the workload for DBC will be intense. In anticipation of that, I plan to try my utmost to be present within myself as much and as often as I can.  I plan to have self check ins wherein I attempt to notice whether I'm getting overwhelmed to the point of shutting down.</p>
          <p>Another aspect of the Abstract Sequential learning style that might prove difficult for me is group work that required me to collaborated with others of  differing views. When I read that description of an Abstract Sequential's characteristics, I felt that it was so true of me.  In the past, soometimes it has been somewhat difficult for me to acutally understand other people's approaches to learning.  In anticipation of all the group work we'll be doing in DBC, I will just have to keep reminding myself that not everyone learns the same.  Knowing this has already made me have some insight into some of the pairing sessions that I've had thus far.</p>
          <h4>Growth and Fixed Mindset and Their Interplay with my Learning Style.</h4>
          <p>During the Phase 0 prerequisite phase, when we firt had to research <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/" target="_blank">Growth & Fixed Mindset</a>, I immediately saw the ways that I've stifled my own learning by placing heavy importance on fixed mindset principles--I've focused on the outcomes of learning rather than the process; I've been reward-focused in learning; I've learned for grades, not for personal edification. Being aware of all these things will help me stay on top of the stuff that can creep up and impede learning and growth, I think. </p>

          <div class="blog" id="blog_entry">
            <p>Alright, noobs.  It's time to put your coding caps on 'cuz were about to learn about  some programming concepts. Read on to find my attempt at describing the ever-elusive subject of Arrays and Hashes.  </p>
            <h4>Arrays and Hashes: What are they? Why are you telling me this?</h4>
            <p>At their most basic, arrays and hashes are things.  That's right, I said things.  To the more erudite among us, Hashes and Arrays can be formally described as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure" target="_blank">data structures</a>, but I assume that if you're reading this blog entry, you're a noob like me and you may or may not have an idea of what a data structure is.  So, let's just keep it simple.  Arrays and Hashes are things--things that store other things. That clear it up?  No? I didn't think so.  </p>
            <p>It might help to think of Arrays and Hashes like tupperware containers made of code.  Like tupperware, Hashes and Arrays can contain itemsâ€”unlike tupperware those items aren't leftovers no one wants.  Indeed, the items they store are called objects.  But because we're all noobs here, and because the idea of objects can get a wee bit complicated when you're just learning about all of this, let's just say that Hashes and Arrays store information.  Better? I thought so.</p>
            <p>Now, Hashes and Arrays can both can store the same type of information, whether strings like “hey you!” or integers like 9--they just differ in their rules of construction and they way they store that information.  Arrays are more rigid--any object you store in an array is going to be indexed by an ordered integer list.  What?  Okay, simple.  Just think of it like this: any information you put in an array will be assigned a number--just like a numbered list.  Except this list begins with zero.    Look at this chart I made.  I hope it makes what I'm trying o say more clear:</p>
            <p><img src="../images/array_Chart.png" /></p>
            <p>I placed the the string “zero” in the first position of my array.  Because of how arrays work, the string “zero”was assigned the number zero.  Don't get it confused though, I could've placed any string in the array and it would've been assigned an integer regardless of what the string was.  You can see that more clearly with the string “peanut butter” which has been assigned the integer 2, because "peanut butterâ€ was the third object placed in my array.  Remember arrays begin they're number assignment at 0.</p>
            <p>Now,  hashes let you store information based on an arbitrary assignment of a value.  Does that sound too computery?  Just look at the hash chart I made to elucidate what I mean:</p>
            <p><img src="../images/hash_Chart.png" /></p>
            <p>In a hash you can place any information you want.  Unlike arrays, hashes don't assign an integer to correspond to the information you've placed within it.  Hashes understand what you put in them as key/value pairs.  So in the chart above, all my keys are names of people.  All my values are associated with those people somehow.  It just so happens that all of the information in my hash above take the form of strings.  But because you can put any object in a hash, the information doesn't have to be a string.  It can be anything!</p>
            <h4>This stuff sounds awesome.  How can I make a Hash?  How can I make an Array?</h4>
            <p>To make array, here's the syntax.  </p>
            <p>array = [ ]  or  array = Array.new( )</p>
            <p>Those commands create and empty arrays. If you want to create an array with information (objects) already in it, you just have to place the information/objects in between the brackets like so:</p>
            <p><img src="../images/mic_Check_Array.png" /></p>
            <p>With  a little finagling (that we won't get into now)  we  could get the above array to return the following to our console:</p>
            <p><img src="../images/mic_Check_Console.png" /></p>
            <p>To make a hash, here's the syntax:</p>
            <p>hash = {} or hash = Hash.new()</p>
            <p>Like the example with arrays above, that creates an empty hash.  If you want to create a hash with information in it already, you can use the following syntax:</p>
            <p><img src="../images/phife_dawg_Hash.png" /></p>
            <p>Again, through the magic of Ruby, you could get the following to show up in the console:</p>
            <p><img src="../images/phife_Dawg_Console.png" /></p>
            <h4>So if they both store information, why do they both exist? Is one better than the other? </h4>
            <p>Now, because I'm a noob myself, and because my experience with / exposure to Arrays and Hashes has been somewhat limited, I honestly struggle a bit with an explanation here.  Hashes are more flexible, obviously, because a developer's not limited to the way information is stored within them.   According to <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/guide-ruby-collections-part-arrays/ ">this article</a>arrays are efficient workhorses that are ubiquitous in ruby. Either way, they're both super-useful to allow information to be stored and accessed at will.  Thus they're both essential concepts to understand in your journey to be a developer, dear noob!</p>

          <div id="line_break"></div>
<!--Actual Blog entry goes below this line-->
          <div class="blog" id="blog_entry">
            <p>I just finished watching a large portion of DBC founder Shereef Bishay's fireside chat, and I really have to say that I'm drinking the Kool-Aid, guys.  Word. This, despite the fact that Karim Bishay expressly stated that DBC isn't asking for that in the pre-phase 0 prep Emotional Intelligence video. Oh, yeaaahh! Haha.</p>
           <p>Joking aside, I was really glad to have watched Shereef's chat; it covered a lot of questions I'd been thinking of prior to watching. The biggest thing I've taken away from the chat--and all of the pre-Phase 0 and Phase 0 work--is that i'm really digging the culture of DBC. I don't mean to sound corny, but it feels like this is the right fit.</p>
            <p>By way of an example, I've engaged in meditation practice on and off for the last year or so.  Recently, my practice has been more off than on--I'm sad to admit--nevertheless, I constantly strive to be present within myself and within social situations.  So, when Karim talked about being present within the context of giving and receiving feedback, that really resonated with me. When Shereef talked about fostering a collaborative environment, that resonated too.  My previous professional environment was so different from all of this.  As a criminal defense attorney, I lived everyday in an a predominantly antagnositc and adversarial world. And honestly, a little part of me felt like it was dying then. DBC feels more like the environment I should have been in; one that fosters creativity and that encourages sharing and openness. This is what I've been looking for.</p>
            <p>Don't get me wrong, I can't pretend I'm coming into this all awe and no fear. I'm scared shitless, guys. I am.  I'm scared of looking stupid.  I'm scared of being vulnerable enough to be okay with saying I'm wrong.  I'm scared of failing.  I'm just heartened that at DBC it seems that it's really okay to be scared and it's really okay to be wrong, and it sounds like DBC is really invested in each of us NOT failing.</p>
           <p>Anyway, that's my little take on this.  I'm really excited to meet everyone at DBC. Just counting down the days until Nov 17th, now!</p></div>

          <div class="blog" id="blog_entry">
            <p>We've touched on many concepts that were new to me in this first week of DBC Phase 0, and I'd like to take a little bit of time to explain some of them in a way that's accessible and hopefully easy to understand.</p>
            <p>Below you'll find my attempt to do just that on the topic of version control and, relatedly, on how git and Github track changes and stores code.</p>
            <h4>Version Control: What is it?</h4>
            <p>Stated (hopefully) simply, version control is  is a process of file management that allows a user to make multiple edits on a file without fear of changing or destroying the original.  Each and every edit can be saved during this process, allowing a user to revisit any former iteration of the file.  It's perhaps most easy to think of it like a save point in a video game. A user has the option to save everything she did up to a point and revisit that specific point whenever she wants.</p>
            <h4>Why is Version Control beneficial?</h4>
            <p>Multiple save points are beneficial because a user never has to fear making changes. She won't have to worry that a change will destroy something she's spent hours creating because, provided that she's saved along the way, she'll be able to revisit any past verison of the file she wants. Within the coding context, this is super helpful.  Code can go through many iterations before the final version.  Using version control, a coder can make edits on a discrete part of the code and test to how that change works within the whole without fear that anything will be destroyed.</p>
            <h4>git and Version Control:  How git helps you Track Changes.</h4>
            <p>Within the git platform, version control is easy to implement. All git folders are tracked folders. What that means is that whenever a user makes a change to a file within a git-tracked folder, git detects it.  A user can check the status of a file's changes by entering "git status" (without the quotes) on the command line from within the appropriate directory. Git will return information about the file's status--from whether it's been modified or whether there's been no changes.</p>
            <p>Once a file has been modified, a user can decide to save--or commit--those changes using the following series of commands:</p>
            <br>git add [file]
            <br>git commit -m "[message about the changes made]"
            <br>git push orgin master
            <br>git add [file] tells git that the user is ready to commit the file--or save the changes made.
            <br>git commit -m "[message]" allows the user to enter a short message about the specific changes to the file.
            <p>Finally, "git push origin master" (again without quotes) "pushes" the changes to the file to the user's remote repository (we haven't covered the meaning of this within this blog post yet--but suffice it to say, a remote repository is like a folder hosted on a server outside the local computer)</p>
            <p>If a user wants to see the entire history of a file's changes, she can enter "git log" (no quotes) on the command line.  This will return the commit number, the author's name, the date and time of the modification and the commit message.</p>
            <h4>GitHub.  What is it?</h4>
            <p>Github is an online platform that allows git users to upload and share files via the site's remote repositories. Not only can users of Github see all versions of any of the uploaded files uploaded to the repositories, but they can also actively make changes on other users' files and submit proposed changes for incorporation, or merging.</p>
            <h4>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h4>
            <p>GitHub has a large and active online community of coders, many of whom are committed to improving code through collaboration. GitHub's remote repositories encourage collaborative work; all members can access other users' public repositories and submit changes to existing files. There is a review process before any changes are incorporated--or merged, however, so there's no fear that one user's changes will overwrite another's. This can allow multiple individuals to work on the same files without destroying the original. In sum, GitHub is a great platform that's collaboration-friendly.</p>
