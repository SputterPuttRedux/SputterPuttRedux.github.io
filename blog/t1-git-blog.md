We've touched on many concepts that were new to me in this first week of DBC Phase 0, and I'd like to take a little bit of time to explain some of them in a way that's accessible and hopefully easy to understand.

Below you'll find my attempt to do just that on the topic of version control and, relatedly, on how git and Github tracks changes and stores code.

Version Control. What is it?

Stated (hopefully) simply, version control is  is a process of file management that allows a user to make multiple saved edits on a file without fear of changing or destroying the original.  Each and every edit can also be saved during this process, allowing a user to revisit any former iteration of the file.  It's perhaps most easy to liken it to a save point in a game. in the coding context, makes a lot of sense b/c coding can go through many iterations before the final

Why is Version Control useful?

like stated above, because the user doesn't have to fear that he or she will destroy something they've spent hours coding.  but also allows for discrete editing on a part, to see how that works within the whole. if it a small part is changed, can always go back to what you had before without having to start over from the beginning.

git and Version Control.  Tracking Changes

Within the git platform, version control is easy to implement. All git folders are tracked folders. What that means is that whenever a user makes a change to a file, git detects it.  A user can check the status of a file's changes by entering "git status" on the command line from within the appropriate directory. Git will return information about the file's status--from whether it's been modified or whether there's been no changes.

In order to save changes to a file, users must
